<p> this is the x factor it came to me when i thought of the clash of red and blue polar oppisites yet when they come together they make another color that does not seem simmilar to either color and intiguing relationship almost as confusing as the laws of nature and the factors of science so i called it the x factor at a tribute to its endless unique outcomes</p>
